# Incident: 2025-11-21 23:04:00 UTC

## Summary

> [!NOTE]
> Write a summary of the incident in a few sentences. Include what happened, why, the severity of the incident and how long the impact lasted.

```md
**summary**:

Between 23:04 UTC & 23:14 UTC on 2025-11-21, 15 users encountered difficulties while purchasing pizzas. The event was triggered by a testing event in the pizza factory service at 14:23 UTC the same day. The testing change contained a randomized error to test our system and ensure we were ready for an event such as the pizza factory going down.

An expected feature in this code caused the pizza factory to fail to fulfill orders until the chaos was resolved. The event was detected by Grafana alerting. The team started working on the event by 23:13 and resolved by 23:14 MDT. This critical incident affected {100%} of users.

```

## Detection

> [!NOTE]
> When did the team detect the incident? How did they know it was happening? How could we improve time-to-detection? Consider: How would we have cut that time by half?

```md
**EXAMPLE**:

This incident was detected when the Pizza Purchase Failure Alert was triggered and Elijah was paged.

SMS alerting will be set up by Elijah so that he can respond and fix the chaos as soon as the alert goes off.
```

## Impact

> [!NOTE]
> Describe how the incident impacted internal and external users during the incident. Include how many support cases were raised.

```md
**EXAMPLE**:

For 10 minutes between 23:04 UTC and 23:14 UTC on 11/21/25, 15 of our users experienced this incident.

This incident affected 15 customers (100% OF Dunemask's Pizza USERS), who experienced the inability to purchase pizzas.

Zero tickets were submitted.
```

## Timeline

> [!NOTE]
> Detail the incident timeline. We recommend using UTC to standardize for timezones.
> Include any notable lead-up events, any starts of activity, the first known impact, and escalations. Note any decisions or changed made, and when the incident ended, along with any post-impact events of note.

```md
**EXAMPLE**:

All times are UTC.

- _21:23_ - Chaos Testing was Initiated
- _23:04_ - First users are affected and unable to purchase pizzas and alert is triggered
- _23:07_ - Elijah responds to the alert and begins investigating
- _23:14_ - Elijah follows the link to end the chaos
- _23:15_ - Issue Fully Resolved and Purchase Alert deactivates
```

## Response

> [!NOTE]
> Who responded to the incident? When did they respond, and what did they do? Note any delays or obstacles to responding.

```md
**EXAMPLE**:

After receiving a page at 23:05 UTC, Elijah came online at 23:07 UTC in Grafana. The issue was then reproduced and resolved after duplicating the workflow on a test machine.
```

## Root cause

> [!NOTE]
> Note the final root cause of the incident, the thing identified that needs to change in order to prevent this class of incident from happening again.

```md
**EXAMPLE**:

An intentional chaos testing event occurred which acted as a test to ensure that alarms and logging were set correctly. To prevent outages like this in the future, chaos testing should not be done during production hours.
```

## Resolution

> [!NOTE]
> Describe how the service was restored and the incident was deemed over. Detail how the service was successfully restored and you knew how what steps you needed to take to recovery.
> Depending on the scenario, consider these questions: How could you improve time to mitigation? How could you have cut that time by half?

```md
**EXAMPLE**:
By following the link to the pizza factory to end the outage and resolve the chaos, the issue was marked as resolved. The issue was not closed until the alarm stopped firing and all metrics returned to normal. 
```

## Prevention

> [!NOTE]
> Now that you know the root cause, can you look back and see any other incidents that could have the same root cause? If yes, note what mitigation was attempted in those incidents and ask why this incident occurred again.

```md
**EXAMPLE**:

There are no other incidents in our system that match these circumstances.

```

## Action items

> [!NOTE]
> Describe the corrective action ordered to prevent this class of incident in the future. Note who is responsible and when they have to complete the work and where that work is being tracked.

```md
**EXAMPLE**:

1. Avoid running chaos testing in production until after its effects are known in a staging and test environment.
2. Do not run this test during production hours.
```
